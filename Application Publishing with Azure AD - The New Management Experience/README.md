In this session we will look into the new management experience of Azure AD Applications in the new Azure Portal. The session will cover publishing and management of Application Proxy applications, Web App/API Applications and Enterprise Applications including SaaS Applications, and how and in which scenarios we can use the new Azure Portal, PowerShell or the Classic Portal for administration. Another important topic that will be covered is how you can configure Conditional Access for those applications for Users and Devices with the Enterprise Mobility & Security offering.

See examples for Azure AD Application Publishing Scenarios at my blog and new and previous articles:
