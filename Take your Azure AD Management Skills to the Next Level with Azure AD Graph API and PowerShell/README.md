Join this session to take your Azure AD Management Skills to the Next Level using Azure Active Directory Graph API through REST API Endpoints and PowerShell! You might think that you would have to be a programmer to use Rest API’s and Azure AD Graph? No, every IT Pro (and Developer) that manages Azure AD and Enterprise Mobility + Security could benefit from learning how to use Rest API, Azure AD Graph and PowerShell to manage administration and security, and for automation and reporting purposes. In this session, I will show you how quick start the set up and requirements, what you can do with Rest API’s, look at what Azure AD Graph API and Microsoft Graph and PowerShell that you cannot do in the Portal, and how you can use that data to create your own cool Azure AD Reports in Power BI! The session will be practical with lot of demos and takeaways.
